# React Demo

## Setup

I've provided both dev mode and a simulated production mode for this project. Dev mode will enable sourcemapping, hot module reload, and live api and client reloading upon changes.  Production mode will simply build a production version of the app and boot them up in readonly mode (no volume mappings). All production flags will be set.

 - Dev Mode: `docker-compose up`
 - Production Mode: `docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod up`
